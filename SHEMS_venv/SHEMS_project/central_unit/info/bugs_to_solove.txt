1. the app have to return the message provided by the http response, for instance if the registration failed, the user will receive "new registration failed" 
and maybe the new layouts/page is again the first one.

2. httpresponse provide to you a string, cast it into a dictionary, example:
backend side:
    d = {a:1, b:2}
    s = str(d)
    httpresponse(d)
frontend side:
    s = httprequest()
    # s is a string
    d = json.loads(s) # in python should be something similar in javascript idk









3.registration:
- the EV dictionary is empty, only that one. .SHEMS_webserver/views.py line 387 i recover the dictionary,
line 391 i print it but it is empty

4. home dosn't show the data provided by the system??

5. schduling has a long list of icons. From my side i can see the data, there is an example of what i provide to you 
in the folder ./info/scheduling_test.json

-> when this is fixed we can check the other commands of this part

5. summary.. i don't understand if it is working or not, i need to prepare a file with all the data stored if not the system 
find some erros due to lack of data

EV_battery, ESS_battery wrong url summary2/

8. community... i don't understand if it is owkring or not, i need to prepare a file like in the summary case
wrong url /plot, correct url community/plots ... prosumers

9. old parameters has a bug.. idk why but the request is performed and it shoudl work but the system dosn't clean the commadns file:
i put a counter that after three times force the cleaninig and send to the user an advice.
I need to insert also famili name in old parameters, i will do it this afternnon is avery quick operation

the info disappear... 

addAppliances 
{
    action: ...
    applianceData: {
        name 
        ...
    }
}
delete appliances ... no present ... check after GET problem fixed
changeSetpoints... no request or wrong?

last point!!!
suggestion: have we got control about the data that are inserted by the user ... 
what happend if the user insert 1000 °C as temperature? or if the minimum battery level is higher than the biggest one
